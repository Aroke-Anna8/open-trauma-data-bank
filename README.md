# Open Trauma Data Bank
The goal of the Open Trauma Data Bank is to provide open bleeding edge
de-identified trauma data. Data access and use will always be completely
free. The idea is to release data as is, regularly, under tight version
control. Released data will never be updated or corrected, but corrections may
be introduced in future releases. To ensure quality data standardized data
collection methods will be used to collect data locally and local data
collection will undergo regular and rigorous quality control. Local identifiable
data will always be owned by individual centres and will be pseudonymised. Data
de-identification will happen locally before de-identified data is uploaded to a
central server. To contribute data to the data bank individual centres have to
comply to data collection standards, quality control, and de-identification
procedures.
